These are some scripts that I use on my Windows workstation to make life easier.

1. md5sum.rb - show md5 checksum of a file passed as argument
2. sha1sum.rb - same as md5sum.rb but for SHA1
3. sha2sum.rb - same as md5sum.rb but for SHA2
4. crunch.py - wordlist generator (not mine)
5. touch.rb - mimicks the touch command on linux
6. stream.py - streams a video's audio using vlc.py
7. vlc.py - stream.py dependency
8. shred.rb - shreds (read: overwrites and deletes) a file passed as argument

Requirements: Pafy (for stream.py)
